# Work Day Planner ReadMe

I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

Note* I have two htmls and 2 style sheets as I tried to redo the code to make the application function better and was not able to do so after redoing it.
